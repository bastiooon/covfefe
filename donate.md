  - title: Women’s March
    content: >
      In January 2017 over 3 million people were on the streets all over the US, actively protesting pretty much everything Trump stands for and to harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change. The New York Times reported that crowd-scientists estimate that the Women’s March was three times the size of the Trump inauguration – we hope the celebrations the day he is ooo will be at least almost as big.
