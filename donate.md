title: Where your money should go
intro: >-
  We don’t have to accept what is going on. If you have some cash to spare, even
  a small amount, there are plenty of organizations you can donate money to – we
  list some of them below. (By the way, we initially planned to collect money for
  these organizations but this is a bit difficult in some cases, legally speaking... stay tuned until we have figure this     out!) Once we've figured this out, you can vote on which organizations we donate a portion of the funds raised. Follow us on Twitter and vote! (Add a date here when voting starts?)

      This organization is urging Congress to pass a resolution calling for the
      House Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds
      exist for the impeachment of Donald J. Trump, President of the United
      States. In other words, they are helping us get the #ooo-party started
      as soon as possible.

      Everytown is a movement of Americans working together to end gun violence
      and build safer communities. More than 4 million mayors, moms, cops,
      teachers, survivors, gun owners, and everyday Americans have come together
      to make their own communities safer. Together, they are fighting for
      changes that will save lives.

      bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization, HRC envisions a
      world where LGBTQ people are ensured of their basic equal rights and can

      In January 2017, over 3 million people were on the streets all over the US,
      actively protesting everything Trump stands for, and harnessing
      the political power of diverse women and their communities with a common goal - to create
      transformative social change. The New York Times reported that
      crowd-scientists estimated the Women’s March attendance was three times the size
      of the Trump inauguration – we hope the celebrations on the day he is ooo
      will be just as large.

      The ACLU’s objective is to preserve and defend each American's individual
      rights and liberties based on the Constitution and laws enacted in the
      USA. In other words, the longer he is in office the more we need the ACLU.

      The National Immigrant Justice Center is a dedicated organization that
      ensures the protection of human rights for all immigrants, asylum seekers,
      and refugees – so basically everything Trump hates. Furthermore, the NIJ also
      enables them to have access to direct legal services and advocates, as it
      pushes for policy reform and systematic change in the legal system.

      Launched after Donald Trump’s election, Indivisible Project became a nationwide
      movement of thousands of local, volunteer-led groups that engage in
      progressive advocacy and electoral work at the local, state, and national
      level. Indivisible Project was established to lift up the grassroots
      movement to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive
      leaders, and realize bold, progressive policies.

      Instead of draining the swamp, he brought the swamp to the White House.
      To a certain extent, this happened under Democratic presidents as well.
      Because it’s time to represent people, not corporations. It's time to take back the party for
      voters, not big money donors.
