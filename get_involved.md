      We’ve all come to realize that Donald is POTUS and it hasn't all been just
      a (terrible) dream. But do you actually know who your district
      representative is? [Find your local representative
      here](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and
      familiarize yourself with their agenda!
    title: 1. Who is who?

      The list of political issues is long and Donald doesn’t seem to make it
      any shorter. If you do not yet have a specific political issue in mind
      (although we suspect you do, otherwise you wouldn’t be here), [check out
      this list](https://www.isidewith.com/polls/social) to find some causes
      that may matter to you

      Now you do feel the urge to contact one of these infamous politicians and
      you want to tell them your opinion? Every now and then we all feel like
      that, don’t we? However, if you’re determined enough to start [find out
      here how to contact the federal elected
      officials.](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)

      The time has come to get off your couch and physically attend a political
      event. A good start is to attend your local town hall meeting to ensure
      your voice is being heard. Town hall meetings can usually be found on your
      city’s website.
    title: 4. Where do I go first?
  - content: >
      The resistance is local and organizations like
      [indivisible.com](https://www.indivisible.org/act-locally/) help you
      finding local, independent groups in your area. Come prepared to make
      plans for action and meet others who are working to resist Trump’s agenda.
    title: 5. How do I find a local group?

      You have already done the most important step which is to motivate
      yourself to do something. But think about mobilizing your family and
      friends to support your cause. Tell them why a particular issue matters
      and ask them to join when you go to town hall meetings etc. Together and
      united we can maximize the impact of this movement!
    title: 6. Who‘s joining?
  - content: >
      Volunteer! If your time and effort allows you, you can give it a try and
      ask for a volunteer position either in your local town hall or in the
      headquarter of the campaign you have joined. This way you’ll gain some
      valuable insights into the inner workings of your party.

      All the effort is worth nothing if you won’t attend any events in order to
      really express your voice and show presence for the cause you’re standing
      up for. [Resistancecalendar.org](https://www.resistancecalendar.org/) is a
      great website to find events nearby.
    title: 8. Where and when can I attend political events?

      There is a movement preparing to hold emergency “Nobody Is Above the Law”
      rallies around the country, in the event they are needed — 900+ of them
      and counting, in every state, with 350,000 RSVPs to date! [Join
      them](https://www.trumpisnotabovethelaw.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response/search/).

      Make sure you vote! Not only in the big elections but also in local ones.
      The truth is that every vote matters – thankfully. [Make sure you are
