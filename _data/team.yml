      Is there something Trump hates more than a strong liberal woman? Yes, if
      she is a journalist on top of it! Just like the rest on the team she knows
      what she will be doing the day he is #ooo … unfortunately she will have to
      work and stay sober to report the latest developments to us. Thanks for
      your service Eli – we will celebrate you and all the fellow journalists on
      the big day :)

      Adam was so mad about Trump that he dumped a side project he was working
      on so he has a couple of hours each weekend to work on thedayheisooo.com.
      He even offered to take the lead with all the legal crap we have to do
      just to sell some stickers – CEO is therefore not a made up startup
      bullshit bingo title, he is the C.E.O. of the TinyHands Ltd.* hell yeah!

      Brian is one of the shy IT guys and the reason everything here looks as
      awesome as it does and runs smoothly. The day he is out of office he will
      have only one beer so he can make sure our servers don't crash! Just
      kidding ... who cares about servers that day?

      In summary Dan already lost 220 bucks betting that Trump will be #ooo by
      certain dates. He says he does not care about it but we are sure: When
      Trump is gone Dan will be mainly celebreating the fact that he won't lose
      any more bets. At least he promised us to stop betting with Republicans
      and focus more on connecting us with all the organizations out there.

      Trang is American but currently living in France. So she is kind of our
      western outpost and will be with the jubilant resistance of American
      expats going wild on the champ elysee after the news of Trumps departure
      breaks. Until then she will support us with her rich experience from
      working with several startups.

      You have lots of motivation, a couple of hours time every week to work pro
      bono and some skills in law, social media, e-commerce, campaign
      management, etc.? Great - as long as your biggest skill is disagreeing
      with everything Trump stands for we should talk! Click on the email button
      and shot Dan an a quick message.
