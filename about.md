intro: >-
  We thought long and hard about adding this section to our website because we are just a
  pretty random group of people and we don’t want to make any of this about us.
  However, we came to understand that even though we don’t take ourselves very
  seriously many of you may care about the team behind the project. We
  assure you a good product, and we support organizations you can
  identify with.


  So, here is the short story about “The Day He is Out Of Office” – we will try
  not to be sarcastic for once. The project - or rather, the idea - began in
  the weeks after the 2016 election. We were deeply troubled by the election results,
  we were scared of Trump’s dangerous agenda, and we were mad about the rigged
  system...but most of all - we felt powerless. We quickly learned, however, that
  thanks to Trump thousands of concerned Americans woke up and came
  together to organize and resist – this gave us hope and made us think about
  ways in which we can support the resistance. There are already so many great non-profit
  organizations out there that it was clear to us that the US does not need
  another one. Instead, we could raise money for the already existing
  organizations in a smart way – after all, product development and campaign
  development is part of our daily business.


  And then, there was this bottle of champagne Dan bought in 2017. He confidently
  told all of us: “I promise you - Trump is dumb as a rock, acts against the
  interest of his own base, and he is a criminal. There is no way he will still
  be president one year from now... As soon as he is out, we will meet to
  pop open this bottle and hit the streets of NYC to celebrate with
  everyone else. Until then, this bottle is my reminder that we will
  eventually win – I call it my 'ooo bottle.'”. Adam joked about how Dan should
  produce a special drink just for this day, kinda like the iconic cigars they
  had in the movie "Independence Day," only to be smoked after
  the evil threat to the US and the whole world was defeated.
    
  It stuck. And the rest will be history ...

  Don't forget - this is all about the movement and not about us! But, in case you have
  serious trust issues, it may ease your mind to see some of the beautiful faces
  behind this project...
