title: About. Who we are.
intro: >-
  We thought long about adding this section to our website because actually we
  are just random people who want to fight the maniac! Most of us are either
  socialists (trigger alarm!), liberal, people with common sense, snowflakes ...
  or all of the above. In other words: The team behind is projects consists of
  people who stand on the right side of history. But we as collective do not
  care about ones political views as long as they are based on facts and science
  and yes, this can totally include conservatives and libertarians. The lowest
  common denominator is that we are mad as fuck about Trump.

  This is a little side project of a diverse team of volunteers. Don't forget:
  This is all about the movement and not about us! However, in case you have
  serious trust issues it might help you to see some of the beutiful faces
  behind the the project.
